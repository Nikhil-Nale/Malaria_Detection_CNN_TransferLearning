# Malaria_Detection_CNN_TransferLearning
I tried to make a CNN model from scratch and models using Transfer learning for identification of malaria images weather they are parasitic or uninfected.

While poor results were obtained using ResNet50 I achieved an accuracy of approx. 98% with validation accuracy about approx. 85% using VGG19 and achieved an accuracy of 99.44% with validation accuracy about 89.55% using CNN model made from scratch.
